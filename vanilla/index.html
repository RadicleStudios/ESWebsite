      <h2>Vanilla night&amp;day</h2>
      <p>
        Vanilla night&amp;day is a Polish luxury nightwear brand founded in
        2006. For more than a decade bedrooms and salons have been graced, from
        Paris, through Rome, Shanghai, and Dubai, to Warsaw. Manufactured using
        only the finest Polish, Italian, and French fabrics in a renovated and
        revitalized historic factory in Lodz. Vanilla night&amp;day is in
        permanent cooperation with the Academy of Fine Arts in Lodz.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feminine, sexy, and very delicate underwear and loungewear, Vanilla was
        created for women who desire to feel pampered and distinguished. Each
        piece is a small work of art incorporating the finest silk, viscose, or
        beautiful lace elements. Making evenings magical and mornings more
        energetic, Vanilla night&amp;day above all celebrate femininity.
      </p>
      <h2>Kasia</h2>
      <p>
        Kasia Pastwa, mathematics graduate, decided to follow her passion and
        create something unique. In 2006 she founded Vanilla to create unique
        nightwear for women who didn't just want to put on that stretched-out
        t-shirt. She wanted to create nightwear whose shape, sewing, and
        details will highlight a woman's form and make her feel special.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was her dream that thanks to Vanilla night&amp;day, women everywhere
        after a hard day's work can still find and celebrate their feminity.
        Today, this dream is a reality, and Kasia Pastwa urges new ladies each
        day, <i>Look after yourself and your feminity, even at night</i>.
